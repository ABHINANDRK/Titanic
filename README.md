# Titanic
The Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.here i have written the code using machine learning algorithm to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.i have used train.csv to train my model and test.csv to test my model.i developed my model using random forest algorithm which is a powerful algorithm for all classification problem.
before running my code you should set the working directory and place train.csv,test.csv.
